            <p>My name is Darius McPhatter, welcome to my first webpage design. I'm currently enrolled in Rutgers Coding
                Bootcamp.  I'm 28 years old with a landscaping business, a partnership with uber, and a mobile DJ.
                I completed college six years ago at Johnson & Wales University with an Associates degree in CADD and
                Bachelor's degree in Enginering Design.</p>
                <p>I like to believe that I picked up a minor in Culinary also because I lived with Culinary students for three of
                the four years off campus.
                I'm currently enrolled in this program so that I can learn some new skills and have a career change.</p>
